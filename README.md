## Overview

The field of [*cryptanalysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis) is concerned with the study of [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher), having as its objective the identification of weaknesses within a cryptographic system that may be exploited to convert encrypted data (cipher-text) into unencrypted data (plain-text). Whether using symmetric or asymmetric techniques, cryptanalysis assumes no knowledge of the correct cryptographic key or even the cryptographic algorithm being used.
Assuming that the cryptographic algorithm is known, a common approach for breaking a cipher is to generate a large number of keys, decrypt a cipher-text with each key and then examine the resultant plain-text. If the text looks similar to English, then the chances are that the key is a good one. The similarity of a given piece of text to English can be computed by breaking the text into fixed-length substrings, called n-grams, and then comparing each substring to an existing map of n-grams and their frequency. This process does not guarantee that the outputted answer will be the correct plain-text, but can give a good approximation that may well be the right answer.
You are required to use the simulated annealing algorithm to break a Playfair Cipher. Your application should have the following minimal set of features:
• A menu-driven command line UI that enables a cipher-text source to be specified (a file or URL) and an output destination file for decrypted plain-text.
• Decrypt cipher-text with a simulated annealing algorithm that uses a log-probability and n-gram statistics as a heuristic evaluation function.
A full description of the Playfair Cipher, a simulated annealing algorithm for breaking ciphers and n-gram statistics are provided below as supplementary material. Note that extra marks will only be given for features that directly relate to the content covered in this module. Do not waste your time developing a complex GUI application.

### The Playfair Cipher Explained


The Playfair Cipher is a symmetric polygram substitution cipher invented by the Victorian scientist Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1854 (of Wheatstone Bridge fame). The cipher is named after his colleague Lord Playfair, who popularised and promoted the encryption system. Due to its simplicity, the Playfair Cipher was used at a tactical level by both the British and US forces during WWII and is also notable for its role in the rescue of the crew of PT-109 in the Pacific in 1943.  

Polygram substitution is a classical system of encryption in which a group of n plain-text letters is replaced as a unit by n cipher-text letters. In the simplest case, where n = 2, the system is called digraphic and each letter pair is replaced by a cipher digraph. The Playfair Cipher uses digraphs to encrypt and decrypt from a 5x5 matrix constructed from a sequence key of 25 unique letters. Note that the letter J is not included.
For the purposes of this assignment, it is only necessary to implement the decrypt functionality of the Playfair Cipher. It should be noted however, that the 5x5 matrix described below can be augmented with auxiliary data structures to reduce access times to O(1). For example, the letter ‘A’ has a Unicode decimal value of 65. Thus, an int array called rowIndices could store the matrix row of a char val at rowIndices[val – 65]. The same principle can be used for columns... The encryption / decryption process works on diagraphs as follows:

+ Step 1: Prime the Plain-Text
Convert the plaintext into either upper or lower-case and strip out any characters that are not present in the matrix. A regular expression can be used for this purpose as follows:
String plainText = input.toUpperCase().replaceAll("[^A-Za-z0-9 ]", "");
Numbers and punctuation marks can be spelled out if necessary. Parse any double letters, e.g. LETTERKENNY and replace the second occurrence with the letter X, i.e. LETXERKENXY. If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, append the letter X to make it even.  

+ Step 2: Break the Plain-Text in Diagraphs
Decompose the plaintext into a sequence of diagraphs and encrypt each pair of letters. The key used below, THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOGS, is written into the 5x5 matrix as THEQUICKBROWNFXMPDVLAZYGS, as only the first 25 unique letters are used to form a key. The plain-text sequence of characters, “ARTIFICIALINTELLIGENCE”, is broken into the diagraph set {AR, TI, FI, CI, AL, IN, TE, LL, IG, EN, CE} and is encrypted into the cipher-text “SIIOOBKCSMKOHQSLBAKDKH” using the following rules:
Rule 1: Diagraph Letters in Different Rows and Columns
Create a “box” inside the matrix with each diagraph letter as a corner and read off the letter at the opposite corner of the same row, e.g. AR→SI. This can also be expressed as cipher(B, P)={matrix[row(B)][col(P)], matrix[row(P)][col(B)]}. Reverse the process to decrypt a cypher-text diagraph.
    
 Rule 2: Diagraph Letters in Same Row
Replace any letters that appear on the same row with the letters to their immediate right, wrapping around the matrix if necessary. Decrypt by replacing cipher-text letters the with letters on their immediate left.
Rule 3: Diagraph Letters in Same Column
Replace any letters that appear on the same column with the letters immediately below, wrapping back around the top of the column if necessary. Decrypt by replacing cipher- text letters the with letters immediately above.
The Playfair Cipher suffers from the following three basic weaknesses that can be exploited to break the cipher, even with a pen and paper:
1. Repeated plain-text digrams will create repeated cipher-text digrams.
2. Digram frequency counts can reveal the most frequently occurring English digrams.
3. The most frequently occurring cipher-text letters are likely to be near the most frequent
English letters, i.e. E, T, A and O in the 5x5 square. This helps to reconstruct the 5x5 square.
We will be exploiting weakness (2) in this assignment. Note that these weaknesses rely on repetition and frequency counts and, in the absence of cribs, require enough cipher-text to reveal patterns. In practice, this implies that at least 200 characters of cipher-text are available.

### The Simulated Annealing Algorithm
Simulated annealing (SA) is an excellent approach for breaking a cipher using a randomly generated key. Unlike conventional Hill Climbing algorithms, that are easily side-tracked by local optima, SA uses randomization to avoid heuristic plateaux and attempt to find a global maxima solution.  
The following pseudocode shows how simulated annealing can be used break a Playfair Cipher. Note that the initial value of the variables temp and transitions can have a major impact on the success of the SA algorithm. Both variables control the cooling schedule of SA and should be experimented with for best results.

##### Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Keys
The generation of a random 25-letter key on line 1 only requires that we shuffle a 25 letter alphabet. A simple algorithm for achieving this was published in 1938 by Fisher and Yates. The Fisher–Yates Shuffle generates a random permutation of a finite sequence, 

The method shuffleKey() on should make the following changes to the key with the frequency given (you can approximate this using Math.random() * 100):
• Swap single letters (90%)
• Swap random rows (2%)
• Swap columns (2%)
• Flip all rows (2%)
• Flip all columns (2%)
• Reverse the whole key (2%)
Note that the semantic network or state space is implicit and that each small change to the 25- character key is logically the same as traversing an edge between two adjacent nodes.

### Using n-Gram Statistics as a Heuristic Function
An n-gram (gram = word or letter) is a substring of a word(s) of length n and can be used to measure how similar some decrypted text is to English. For example, the quadgrams (4-grams) of the word “HAPPYDAYS” are “HAPP”, “APPY”, “PPYD”, “PYDA”, “YDAY” and “DAYS”. A fitness measure or heuristic score can be computed from the frequency of occurrence of a 4-gram, q, as follows: `P(q) = count(q) / n`, where n is the total number of 4- grams from a large sample source. 

An overall probability of the phrase “HAPPYDAYS” can be accomplished by multiplying the probability of each of its 4-grams:
`P(HAPPYDAYS) = P(HAPP) × P(APPY) × P(PPYD) × P(PYDA) × P(YDAY)`

One side effect of multiplying probabilities with very small floating point values is that underflow can occur1 if the exponent becomes too low to be represented. For example, a Java float is a 32-bit IEEE 754 type with a 1-bit sign, an 8-bit exponent and a 23-bit mantissa. The 64-bit IEEE 754 double has a 1-bit sign, a 11-bit exponent and a 52-bit mantissa. A simple way of avoiding this is to get the log (usually base 10) of the probability and use the identity log(a × b) = log(a) + log(b). 

Thus, the score, h(n), for “HAPPYDAYS” can be computed as a log probability:
`log10(P(HAPPYDAYS)) = log10(P(HAPP)) + log10(P(APPY)) + log10(P(PPYD)) + log10(P(PYDA)) + log10(P(YDAY)`
The resource quadgrams.txt is a text file containing a total of 389,373 4-grams, from a maximum possible number of 264=456,976. 

The 4-grams and the count of their occurrence were computed by sampling a set of text documents containing an aggregate total of 4,224,127,912 4-grams. The top 10 4-grams and their occurrence is tabulated below:
The 4-grams of “HAPPYDAYS”, their count, probability and log value are tabulated below.
The final score, h(n), for “HAPPYDAYS” is just the sum of the log probabilities, i.e. 
`- 3.960779349 + -4.557751689 + -5.964871583 + -6.467676267 + -4.590956247 + - 3.822746584 = -29.36478172. `

A decrypted message with a larger score than this is more “English” than this text and therefore must have been decrypted with a “better” key.
